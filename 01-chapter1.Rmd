# First Chapter: Figures

By default, bookdown merges all Rmd files by the order of filenames, e.g., 01-intro.Rmd will appear before 02-literature.Rmd. Filenames that start with an underscore _ are skipped. If there exists an Rmd file named index.Rmd, it will always be treated as the first file when merging all Rmd files.


```{r ThisIsAFigureChunk, fig.cap="A caption like this one is necessary for the figure to be referenceable!", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

invisible(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(data=diamonds) + geom_density(aes(colour=cut,x=price)) +facet_grid(cut~.)
```


This is a pdf/latex only reference for Figure \ref{fig:ThisIsAFigureChunk}. It links to the figure in chapter 1.

This is a "bookdown" reference for Figure \@ref(fig:ThisIsAFigureChunk). It should work for any bookdown format that supports references.


And here is a reference to the chapter 2 table: Table \ref{tab:TableChunk}.
And the "bookdown" reference: Table \@ref(tab:TableChunk).

Bye.
